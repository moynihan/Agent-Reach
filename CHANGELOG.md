## [1.6.0] - 2026-10-23

- Upgrading from an older version: just send your AI the "update Agent Reach" sentence. Your keys and settings are kept, and the old program is removed for you.
- Adding a platform takes one sentence. Everything it needs is installed for you, with no admin password; you only log in or enter a key.
- Platforms that need a login, such as Xiaohongshu and X, now use Agent Reach's own browser in the background, never yours, and several AIs can search at once.
- RSS and Exa search are now part of "web". When a new version is out, your AI tells you in plain words what changed and updates only if you say yes.

1.6 is a rebuild. Agents call one command, `agent-reach`; everything Agent Reach installs or stores lives under `~/.agent-reach/`.

Technical:
- 28 of 40 actions passed real acceptance before release; these shipped untested with maintainer approval: Reddit (test network blocked), Instagram (rate limited), Bilibili subtitles, LinkedIn, Xueqiu hot posts/stocks (no login), Xiaoyuzhou (no key).
- Fixed: an unauthenticated `gh` no longer blocks the public GitHub API; public quotes no longer trigger the browser; wrong authentication hints; cleanup of unrecorded caches. Temporary audio and subtitle files stay under the Reach directory. BOSS in-site search prefers official OpenCLI, and upstream JD adapter failures are reported separately. Both PRs and releases check real acceptance and pending validation.
- For declared public search/read scopes, the CLI reuses web tools first and does not prepare the browser when that succeeds; results are labelled with their source and content scope, and login is suggested only when the in-site path explicitly requires authentication. A backend can be specified to keep the original in-site capability.
- Browser channels share one profile, close after ten idle minutes and reopen on demand.
- Adding a channel prepares its tools; removal clears only that site's login. Default platforms can be removed and updates won't add them back.
- Updating keeps tools that have a tested version at that version; other tools get the newest version inside their supported range.
- Public content remains public-first, with a compact capability receipt after install.
- Keep Xiaoyuzhou transcription; remove the extra planner and duplicate site extraction.
- The Bridge is managed together with the dedicated browser; the idle timer follows real page activity and the login is saved periodically. A failed cleanup keeps the channel; uninstall deletes only files recorded in the ledger. A release requires real channel acceptance.
- Reuse existing local site sessions read-only; queries default to headless, with a visible window for human login that shares the same profile. Bilibili subtitles and the Xueqiu community sync their login automatically; BOSS JD uses the upstream browser interface. Missing interfaces and rate limits are no longer misreported as a need to log in again.
- The dedicated browser is identified by the id its extension saves inside its own profile, so the user's own Chrome is never mistaken for it; a query no longer closes an open login window.
- Browser channels run queries in parallel: up to 2 per platform and 4 in total, with the rest queued instead of failing BUSY at once; login windows, logout and browser setup wait for running queries.
- Report NEED_LOGIN instead of UPSTREAM_BROKEN when not logged in: Xueqiu community (error 400016), Bilibili subtitles (no Bilibili login), LinkedIn (no LinkedIn login in the dedicated browser).
- Smoother upgrade from 1.5: install and update share one guide, install.md, which checks the version first (update.md, where 1.5 sends users, points to it); `agent-reach update` moves a pip/pipx install to uv by itself; `setup` removes the old Agent Reach program (only Agent Reach itself) and the install report explains what was kept, what changed and which old channels can be added back. Install URLs always point at the latest release.
- Upstream errors reach the agent unchanged (the original message and help); the agent tells the user which platform is temporarily unavailable, by platform name. Reach no longer replaces them with its own advice (NEED_LOGIN still gives Reach's dedicated-browser login steps).

### ✨ New

- **Unified entry**: `agent-reach <channel> <action>`, `agent-reach read <url>`, `agent-reach channels`. One JSON envelope per call, unified error codes with hints, per-call timeout, automatic fallback to the next backend.
- **Management commands**: `setup`, `add` / `remove <channel>`, `login` / `logout <channel>`, `doctor`, `check`, `skill`, `skill link <dir>`, `update`, `configure`, `uninstall`.
- **One-step setup**: `setup` adds every default channel through the same path as `add` (bili-cli goes into `~/.agent-reach/tools/`) and reports what works, which AIs can read the skill, optional channels and optional logins.
- **Skill placement**: one real copy at `~/.agents/skills/agent-reach/SKILL.md` (read directly by Codex, OpenCode, Cline, Warp, Zed); a link to it in the skill folder of Claude Code, OpenClaw, Hermes, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot and Windsurf when installed (a copy where links are not allowed, e.g. Windows). `agent-reach skill link <dir>` covers any other AI.
- **Private upstream installs, tested versions**: tools go into `~/.agent-reach/tools/`; the user's own copies are untouched. Tools with a declared tested version install at that version, and `update` keeps them there; other tools install the newest version inside `floor` and `exclude`, which also define acceptable existing tools. `state.json` records the version actually installed and `doctor` shows it. Single-instance tools (OpenCLI) reuse the user's copy; if it is outside the supported versions, it is upgraded only with `--allow-upgrade`.
- **`add` gives a finished result**: missing prerequisites are installed without an admin password: uv (official script), ffmpeg (`imageio-ffmpeg` in a private venv), Node.js (official release under `~/.agent-reach/tools/node/` when the system has none), CloakBrowser (falling back to installed Chrome on download failure). git is no longer needed (Boss installs from a GitHub archive). The user only logs in or enters a key.
- **Login state under `~/.agent-reach/`**: CLI tool logins in `sessions/`, browser logins in a dedicated Agent Reach browser. The browser opens by itself when a channel needs it and closes after 10 minutes without use. The OpenCLI extension is loaded automatically on each CloakBrowser launch; Windows system-Chrome fallback may need one Web Store click. Only the requested site's cookies are copied read-only from an existing connected local browser; the source remains unchanged.
- **remove cleans up**: deletes the channel's private tools nobody else uses, its CLI session, its login keys and its site cookies in the Agent Reach browser. The shared browser profile is retained for explicit logout/reuse; unused private tools are pruned.
- **Removable default channels**: `state.json` records `removed_defaults`; `setup` and `update` never add them back; `add` brings one back.
- **doctor states**: not_added, needs_setup, needs_login, unverified, ready, broken; plus `regressed` per channel (passed in the previous check, fails in the latest).
- **update** runs `uv tool install --force` on the latest release, reinstalls every added channel's tools at their declared versions (tested version when set, otherwise the newest version inside `floor`/`exclude`; also when Agent Reach itself has no new release), prunes tools no added channel uses, drops channels no longer in the registry, and refreshes the skill. `result.user_actions` lists in plain sentences what the user must do afterwards. Rollback: `uv tool install --force <previous release zip>`, then `agent-reach update --sync-only`. uv is the only supported installer. 1.5 and earlier installs are migrated on first `setup` / `update`; `config.yaml` keys are kept.
- **Update notice**: explicit `update --check` refreshes the release cache. Ordinary queries never start a background version check or update dependencies. Cached newer releases appear in `meta.update`; updating requires the user's agreement.
- **Release notes**: every CHANGELOG version section starts with a plain summary for users; it becomes the GitHub release body the AI shows users.
- Xueqiu quotes and stock search via Tencent public quotes (no login); Xueqiu community data uses a session synced from the dedicated browser with `agent-reach login xueqiu --sync`.
- YouTube `transcribe`; LinkedIn reuses OpenCLI search and job-detail in the shared dedicated browser.

### 🔄 Changed

- Default channels: web (fallback only), YouTube, GitHub, V2EX, Bilibili. Optional: Xiaohongshu, Reddit, LinkedIn, Boss Zhipin, Xiaoyuzhou, Xueqiu. Experimental: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
- The agent skill is generated from the channel list and replaced on every update.

### 🗑️ Removed

- RSS channel (agents read feeds themselves).
- xhs-cli, rdt-cli, twitter-cli backends: they read browser cookies by themselves.
- `configure --from-browser`, `twitter-cookies`, `xhs-cookies`, the old `install --channels`, the old `skill --install`, `format`, `check-update`, MCP server entry.
- `watch` (use `doctor`, which now reports `regressed`), `doctor --live` (use `check`), `browser start` (the browser opens by itself), pipx installs.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### 🔐 Boss Zhipin — misjudged login state (two credential stores)

- **Root cause:** Boss has two login-state stores that do not represent each other: the local `~/.boss-agent/auth/session.enc` and the browser cookies inside the dedicated Chrome profile. `boss status` / `status --live` **only checked the former** (a legacy credential store from the Bridge/httpx era), while searches in strict `existing-browser` CDP mode use the browser cookies. With "stale local credentials + browser not logged in", `boss status` reported `logged_in: true`, which led the agent to skip login, search directly and hit `AUTH_EXPIRED`; the old runbook also forbade treating `_security_check` as "not logged in", and the two rules together pushed the agent down the wrong "anti-bot slider" branch.
- **Fix:** `check()` gained a fourth read-only probe, `_cdp_zhipin_login_cookie()`: a minimal WebSocket client written with the standard library alone asks the CDP browser itself (`Storage.getCookies`) whether the zhipin `wt2` cookie exists. **The browser is the source of truth**; no new dependency, no browser launch, no search. No `wt2` → report clearly that the browser is not logged in and a search would return `AUTH_EXPIRED`, pointing to "user logs in + `login --cdp`"; probe failure → report "login state unknown"; the security-check page hint also carries the browser cookie state.
- **Runbook correction:** removed the misleading rule "trust only `boss status` for login state" in favour of doctor's browser cookie probe; after starting the dedicated Chrome, **always pause so the user can confirm the login state by eye**; `AUTH_EXPIRED` is ground truth (go straight to the login flow, never explain it as a security check), and `_security_check` is handled as a slider only when there is no `AUTH_EXPIRED`.

### ✨ Features

#### 🎯 Boss Zhipin channel

- New `boss` channel: searches jobs and fetches the full JD through boss-agent-cli + a real Chrome over CDP.
- `check()` runs four read-only probes (boss-agent-cli installed → port 9222 reachable → a zhipin tab present → the `wt2` login cookie present in the browser).
- Fetching uses the public API (`search_jobs` + `job_card_browser` + `browser_source="existing-browser"`).
- `agent-reach install --system --channels=boss` installs the backend pinned to a fixed upstream boss-agent-cli commit (#403–#407 merged into master); switch back to a version constraint once upstream publishes a release.
- The skill and install guide support "set up Boss Zhipin for me": the agent starts a dedicated Chrome listening on loopback only, the user logs in manually, and the agent verifies the login state and the CDP link at the end.
- The pinned dependency moved from the fork snapshot `8ff6bd3` to upstream commit `4c991b7` (#403–#407 merged into master): a logged-in CDP session can be reused directly, and `--browser-source existing-browser` prevents a headless downgrade during search.
- Code 37 is classified by its original message: an environment anomaly becomes `ENVIRONMENT_RISK` and stops immediately; only an explicit token/stoken expiry allows one refresh. The dedicated Chrome profile should be reused long-term at a low request rate.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-27

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### 📈 Xueqiu — comprehensive fix

- **Fixed the root cause of the 400 errors:** `_ensure_cookies()` only visited the homepage, which yields just `acw_tc` (an anti-DDoS token); `xq_a_token` is generated dynamically by Xueqiu's front-end JavaScript and cannot be obtained with plain HTTP requests. Added a three-level cookie loading strategy: ① read the config file (saved by `--from-browser`) → ② extract automatically from the local Chrome browser (requires browser-cookie3) → ③ homepage fallback.
- **Fixed the User-Agent:** `"agent-reach/1.0"` was recognised and rejected by Xueqiu's anti-bot system; switched to a real Chrome UA.
- **Fixed the missing `Referer` header:** all API requests now send `Referer: https://xueqiu.com/`.
- **Fixed the `get_hot_posts()` endpoint:** the old endpoint `/statuses/hot/listV3.json` is deprecated (returns an empty body); switched to `/v4/statuses/public_timeline_by_category.json` and parse the `item.data` JSON string correctly for author/likes/text.
- **Fixed `urllib.request.quote` → `urllib.parse.quote`:** use the correct module explicitly.
- **Fixed `configure --from-browser` not extracting Xueqiu cookies:** added Xueqiu to `PLATFORM_SPECS`; the cookie is saved only when `xq_a_token` is present.
- **Corrected misleading docs:** "no configuration needed" / "public API, no login required" in README/SKILL.md now accurately say a browser cookie is required.
- **Better error message:** a failed `check()` now suggests `configure --from-browser chrome` instead of "a proxy may be needed".
